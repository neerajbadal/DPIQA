# DPIQA
#### Source code for DPIQA model for quality assessment of pan-sharpened images at original resolution
#### Download test data numpy files for Worldview-2 (wv2), Worldview-4 (wv4) and Ikonos (ik) from below link,

> Due to size contraint of Worldview-3 numpy data files and actual raw images ( original large images through which patches were extracted for all the satellites), google drive list is not present here. Kindly email us to neerajbadal15@gmail.com to make those dataset available.
